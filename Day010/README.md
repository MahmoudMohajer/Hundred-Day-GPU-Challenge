**First 10 Days - GPU Programming Progress Summary**

1. **Core CUDA Fundamentals**  
   ✅ Day 1-2: Basic kernel setup, thread/block indexing (1D/2D)  
   ✅ Day 3-4: Memory management (host/device), performance benchmarking (CUDA Events)  
   ✅ Day 5-6: 2D matrix ops, code modularity with `__device__` functions  

2. **Performance Optimization**  
   ⚡ Day 4: Identified memory transfer bottlenecks (~98% runtime)  
   ⚡ Day 7: Block size optimization (8x8 → 32x32) with Nsight profiling  

3. **Real-World Applications**  
   🖼️ Day 8: Image processing (brightness adjustment) with PGM I/O  
   🌀 Day 9: Box blur with boundary handling (configurable kernel size)  
   🧮 Day 10: Matrix multiplication (2D thread mapping, dot product)  

**Key Progression**  
`Hello World` → `Vector Ops` → `Image Processing` → `Linear Algebra`  
*Focus Shift*: Basic syntax → Memory optimization → Real-world applications  

**Tools Mastered**  
`nvcc` | `cudaMemcpy` | `Nsight` | `PGM I/O` | `2D Grid/Block Design`
