# Day 010 - Matrix Multiplication using CUDA

## Objective
Implement a parallel matrix multiplication algorithm using CUDA that efficiently computes the product of two matrices. This project demonstrates basic CUDA programming concepts and parallel computation patterns for fundamental linear algebra operations.

## Concepts Covered
- Matrix Multiplication Algorithm
- 2D Grid and Block Organization
- Shared Memory Considerations
- Basic CUDA Memory Management
- Thread Indexing in 2D

## Key Components
1. **Matrix Multiplication Kernel:**
   - Row and column computation
   - Element-wise multiplication and accumulation
   - Proper indexing for matrices
   - Parallel processing per output element

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Host and device memory allocation
   - Matrix data transfer
   - Proper cleanup of allocated resources

3. **Thread Organization:**
   - 2D block configuration
   - Grid dimension calculation
   - Thread index computation

## Key Learning Points
1. Understanding matrix multiplication parallelization
2. Managing 2D thread and block organization
3. Implementing efficient memory access patterns
4. Computing grid dimensions for matrices
5. Basic CUDA memory management

## Building and Running
1. Compile with nvcc:
   ```bash
   nvcc matrix_mul.cu -o matrix_mul
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./matrix_mul
   ```

## Implementation Details
The matrix multiplication kernel processes each output element in parallel, where:
- Each thread computes one element of the output matrix
- Thread indices determine which row and column to process
- The kernel performs dot product of a row from matrix A and a column from matrix B
- Current implementation works with 3x3 matrices as an example

## Notes
- Current implementation uses fixed-size 3x3 matrices
- Uses row-major matrix storage
- Demonstrates basic CUDA concepts without optimization
- Could be extended for arbitrary matrix sizes
- Uses block dimensions of 3x3 for this example

## Results
The program multiplies two 3x3 matrices and outputs the result. For example:
- Input Matrix A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
- Input Matrix B = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
- Output shows the resulting matrix multiplication

## Performance Considerations
- Simple implementation without shared memory optimization
- Memory coalescing could be improved
- Block size could be optimized for larger matrices
- Memory transfer overhead for small matrices
- Future optimizations could include shared memory usage and tiling
