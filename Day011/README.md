# Day 011 - Matrix Multiplication Performance Benchmarking

## Objective
Analyze and benchmark the performance of CUDA matrix multiplication with different block sizes using larger matrices (1024x1024) and systematic performance measurement techniques.

## Concepts Covered
- CUDA Event API for Precise Timing
- Block Size Impact on Performance
- Warm-up Runs for Accurate Benchmarking
- Multiple Iteration Averaging
- Large-scale Matrix Operations

## Key Components
1. **Performance Measurement Setup:**
   - CUDA Events for precise timing
   - Warm-up runs to stabilize GPU
   - Multiple iterations for reliable results
   - Average time calculation

2. **Matrix Configuration:**
   - 1024x1024 matrix dimensions
   - Random value initialization
   - Efficient memory management
   - Support for different matrix sizes

3. **Block Size Analysis:**
   - Testing multiple configurations (8x8, 16x16, 32x32)
   - Grid dimension auto-calculation
   - Performance comparison across sizes
   - Thread organization optimization

## Key Learning Points
1. Impact of block sizes on performance
2. Importance of warm-up runs in GPU benchmarking
3. Proper performance measurement techniques
4. Memory management for large matrices
5. Grid/block dimension optimization

## Building and Running
1. Compile with nvcc:
   ```bash
   nvcc matmul_benchmark.cu -o matmul_benchmark
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./matmul_benchmark
   ```

## Implementation Details
The benchmark implementation includes:
- Systematic testing of different block sizes
- Automatic grid dimension calculation
- 10 iterations per configuration for averaging
- Proper cleanup of CUDA resources
- Support for large matrix dimensions

## Notes
- Uses 1024x1024 matrices for realistic workload
- Tests three block configurations: 8x8, 16x16, and 32x32
- Includes warm-up runs to avoid cold-start effects
- Measures average execution time over 10 iterations
- Proper error handling and resource management

## Results
Benchmark results for matrix multiplication (1024x1024 * 1024x1024):

| Block Size | Grid Size | Average Time (ms) |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 8×8        | 128×128   | 3.531            |
| 16×16      | 64×64     | 2.911            |
| 32×32      | 32×32     | 3.107            |

Key observations:
- 16×16 block size provides the best performance
- 8×8 blocks show the slowest execution time
- 32×32 blocks perform slightly worse than 16×16
- Grid sizes automatically adjust to maintain full matrix coverage

## Performance Considerations
- Memory transfer overhead not included in kernel timing
- Block size impact on occupancy and performance
- Grid dimension effects on parallelization
- Warm-up runs importance for stable measurements
- Multiple iterations for statistical reliability
