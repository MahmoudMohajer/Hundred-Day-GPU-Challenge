## Concepts Covered
- Thread Synchronization (`__syncthreads()`)
- Shared Memory Usage
- Parallel Reduction Algorithm
- Multiple-pass Reduction
- Block-level Synchronization
- Memory Coalescing

## Key Components

1. **Parallel Reduction Implementation:**
   - Hierarchical sum reduction
   - Shared memory for block-level operations
   - Multiple kernel launches for large arrays
   - Efficient thread synchronization

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Dynamic shared memory allocation
   - Device memory for large arrays (268M elements)
   - Memory transfer optimization
   - Proper cleanup of resources

3. **Synchronization Features:**
   - Block-level thread synchronization
   - Multiple reduction passes
   - Efficient parallel sum computation
   - Memory access pattern optimization

## Performance Considerations
- Uses shared memory for faster access
- Implements stride-based reduction
- Avoids warp divergence in reduction loop
- Efficient memory coalescing pattern

## Building and Running
1. Compile with nvcc:
   ```bash
   nvcc synchronization.cu -o synchronization
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./synchronization
   ```

## Implementation Details
- Array size: 1 << 28 (268,435,456) elements
- Block size: 256 threads
- Shared memory: 256 floats per block
- Multiple reduction passes for large arrays
- Error checking throughout execution

## Key Learning Points
