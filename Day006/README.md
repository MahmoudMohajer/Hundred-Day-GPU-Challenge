# Day 006 - Modular Matrix Addition in CUDA

## Objective
Implement a modular approach to matrix addition using CUDA, focusing on code organization and reusability through device functions.

## Concepts Covered
- Device Functions in CUDA
- Code Modularity
- 2D Matrix Operations
- Function Abstraction in GPU Computing
- Memory Management for Large Matrices

## Key Components
1. Device Function Implementation:
   - Modular index calculation function
   - Separation of concerns in kernel code
   - Reusable matrix indexing logic

2. Matrix Configuration:
   - 1024 x 1024 matrix dimensions
   - 2D thread and block organization
   - Efficient memory layout

3. Code Organization:
   - Separate device function for index calculation
   - Clean kernel implementation
   - Structured memory management

## Key Learning Points
1. Understanding device function usage in CUDA
2. Benefits of modular code in GPU programming
3. Proper function abstraction for parallel computing
4. Code reusability in CUDA applications
5. Structured approach to matrix operations

## Building and Running
1. Compile with nvcc:
   ```bash
   nvcc modular_matrixAdd.cu -o modular_matrixAdd
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./modular_matrixAdd
   ```

## Notes
